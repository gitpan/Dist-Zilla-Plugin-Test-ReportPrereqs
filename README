NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportPrereqs - Report on prerequisite
    versions during automated testing

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini
      [Test::ReportPrereqs]

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin adds a t/00-report-prereqs.t test file. If
    AUTOMATED_TESTING is true, it reports the version of all modules listed
    in the distribution metadata prerequisites (including 'recommends',
    'suggests', etc.).

    If a MYMETA.json file exists and CPAN::Meta is installed on the testing
    machine, MYMETA.json will be examined for prerequisites as it would
    include any dynamic prerequisites. Otherwise, a static list of
    prerequisites is used, generated when distribution tarball was built.

    Versions are reported based on the result of "parse_version" from
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which means prerequisite modules are not actually
    loaded (which avoids various edge cases with certain modules). Parse
    errors are reported as "undef". If a module is not installed, "missing"
    is reported instead of a version string.

SEE ALSO
    Other Dist::Zilla::Plugins do similar things in slightly different ways
    that didn't suit my style and needs.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta -- requires prereqs to be
        satisfied

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportVersions -- bundles a copy of
        YAML::Tiny, reads prereqs only from META.yml, and attempts to load
        them with "require"

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportVersions::Tiny -- static list only,
        loads modules with "require"
