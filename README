NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportPrereqs - Report on prerequisite
    versions during automated testing

VERSION
    version 0.016

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini
      [Test::ReportPrereqs]
      include = Acme::FYI
      exclude = Acme::Dont::Care

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin adds a t/00-report-prereqs.t test file and an
    accompanying t/00-report-prereqs.dd data file. It reports the version of
    all modules listed in the distribution metadata prerequisites (including
    'recommends', 'suggests', etc.). However, any 'develop' prereqs are not
    reported (unless they show up in another category).

    If a MYMETA.json file exists and CPAN::Meta is installed on the testing
    machine, MYMETA.json will be examined for prerequisites in addition, as
    it would include any dynamic prerequisites not set in the distribution
    metadata.

    Versions are reported based on the result of "parse_version" from
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, which means prerequisite modules are not actually
    loaded (which avoids various edge cases with certain modules). Parse
    errors are reported as "undef". If a module is not installed, "missing"
    is reported instead of a version string.

    Additionally, if CPAN::Meta is installed, unfulfilled required
    prerequisites are reported after the list of all versions based on
    either MYMETA (preferably) or META (fallback).

CONFIGURATION
  include
    An "include" attribute can be specified (multiple times) to add modules
    to the report. This can be useful if there is a module in the dependency
    chain that is problematic but is not directly required by this project.

  exclude
    An "exclude" attribute can be specified (multiple times) to remove
    modules from the report (if you had a reason to do so).

  verify_prereqs
    When set, installed versions of all 'requires' prerequisites are
    verified against those specified. Defaults to true, but requires
    CPAN::Meta to be installed.

SEE ALSO
    Other Dist::Zilla::Plugins do similar things in slightly different ways
    that didn't suit my style and needs.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::PrereqsFromMeta -- requires prereqs to be
        satisfied

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ReportVersions -- bundles a copy of
        YAML::Tiny, reads prereqs only from META.yml, and attempts to load
        them with "require"

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportVersions::Tiny -- static list only, loads
        modules with "require"
